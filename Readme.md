# Music Genre Prediction Web Application

This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to predict music genres based on age and gender inputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/predict` in your web browser.
2. Enter the age, gender, and genre of the music you want to predict.
3. Click the "Submit" button to make the prediction.

## How it Works

- The application uses a decision tree classifier to predict music genres based on the provided age and gender inputs.
- Users can input their data via a simple web form (`/predict`) and view the predicted genre (`/result`).
